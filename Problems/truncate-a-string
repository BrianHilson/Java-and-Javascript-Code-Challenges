Create a function which takes two parameters: a string and an integer. If the string is longer than the given integer, the function
returns a truncated version of the string, with "..." at the end. The total length of the string returned should be the length of the 
given integer. 
Example: Inputs = "Some like it hot.", 11
         Output = "Some like it..."


If the given integer is 3 or less, the function returns the string truncated to the length of the integer, with "..." added at the end.
Example: Inputs = "What the heck!", 2
         Output = "Wh..."
         
If the integer is greater than the length of the given string, the entire string is returned, without "...".
