# Java-and-Javascript-Code-Challenges
Java and JavaScript solutions for common programming problems

In late 2017 I finished this course http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/ from the University of Helsinki. This taught me some of the fundamentals of programming using Java. I then started learning front end development because I wanted to begin building web apps. The coding problems in this repo are from the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithm Scripting section. 

It would be a shame to forget everything I've learned about Java, so I'm solving all the problems in Java and JavaScript.
